    #Welcome my dear successor!
    #
    #The last 2.5 months I have put a lot of effort in the project you now have 
    #before you. I think the project has great potential and hope you enjoy 
    #working on it, while taking it to the next level.
    
    #The aim of this project was to combine data of three different sources and 
    #to build a proof-of-concept model. The three different sources are:
    #1. A height map of the Netherlands (AHN2_5m) (INPUT)
    #   source: https://geodata.nationaalgeoregister.nl/ahn2/atom/ahn2_5m.xml
    #2. Precipitation data from the KNMI (rad_nl25_rac_mfbs_01h) (INPUT)
    #   source: https://data.knmi.nl/datasets/rad_nl25_rac_mfbs_01h/2.0
    #3. Tweets with geo location (OUTPUT)
    #   source: Twitter
    
    #In order to combine the data, the raw data is converted into pandas 
    #dataframes and then saved to .csv files. These .csv files can be easily 
    #reloaded into pandas dataframes, which allow for easy data selection and 
    #recombination.
    #Building the proof-of-concept model consist of 4 steps:
    #1. Train an autoencoder on the heightmap
    #2. Generate terrain features using the autoencoder
    #3. Combine different data sets
    #4. Train a Random Forest Classifier on the combined data sets
    
    #These 4 steps can be repeated in a loop to perform automated machine
    #learning. Step 2 and 3 can be swapped if it is desired to generate
    #features on every entry in the combined dataset. The current order of
    #steps is due to time management. Since features are generated per (KNMI) 
    #radar pixel, it saves time to first generate features for every radar 
    #pixel, and then recombine the output with the different datasets.
    
    #Now to get into the details:
    
    #---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    #Getting the data
    #---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    #First of all, we need to get the raw data.
    #The AHN2_5m heightmap can be downloaded from 
    #https://geodata.nationaalgeoregister.nl/ahn2/atom/ahn2_5m.xml
    #Since this is an .xml file and not a link to a download, I recommend
    #using the two bash scripts "scrape" and "download". They can be found
    #in this repository in the "scripts" folder. 
    #To download, follow these steps:
    #1. Make a folder called "AHN2_5m" in the superfolder where you downloaded 
    #   this repository. Don't download the data into this repository, since it
    #   is too large to upload to GitHub.
    #2. Copy the "scrape" and "download" scripts to this newly created "AHN2_5m"
    #   folder. Open a Unix terminal, navigate to this "AHN2_5m" folder and
    #   execute the following commands:
    #   ./scrape
    #   ./download
    #3. After the download is complete, unzip all the downloaded .zip files
    #   and then remove the .zip files, to save on disk space.

    #The Precipitation data from the KNMI can be downloaded from: 
    #https://data.knmi.nl/datasets/rad_nl25_rac_mfbs_01h/2.0
    #Copy this link into your browser and click the "Download the matching data"
    #button. Save the .zip file to the superfolder of the repository, unzip it
    #and unzip every .zip file in it.

    #Twitter data can not be downloaded simply, you need a paid subscription to 
    #Twitter developer. In order to get twitter data, follow these steps:
    #1. Log into your Twitter account
    #2. Navigate to https://developer.twitter.com/
    #3. Navigate to Products -> Products overview
    #4. Choose the product you want to purchase. I recommend Premium 
    #   Full-archive 
    #5. Make a new folder "Twitter_cred" in the superfolder of this repository.
    #   This folder will store your Twitter query results. It
    #   is important not to store these query results in the
    #   repository, since in that case they can be viewed by anyone.
    #6. Make a file called "~/.twitter_keys.yaml". Be sure to make this in your
    #   home directory and not in the repository. For more info on how to do
    #   this, see:
    #   https://github.com/twitterdev/search-tweets-python/blob/master/README.rst
    #7. Run the query, or skip this step if you allready have the Tweets:
    skip_twitter_query = True
    if not skip_twitter_query:
        from Twitter.searchtweets_query import searchtweets_query
        searchtweets_query(file_name='../Twitter_cred/full_arch_2007-2020.txt')
    
    #---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    #Training the autoencoder
    #---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    #Trainig the autoencoder is done through the class "class_experiment".
    #This class expects a dictionary called "parameters", which defines several
    #parameters of the experiment. The class "class_experiment" allows for
    #easy runs and loads of the experiment. The parameters can be stored in a
    #script as can be seen in the folder "experiments". This way an experiment
    #can be reviewed at later times, while all it's parameters are stored. It
    #can be easily reran by typing "experiment_name.py run" and it's results
    #can be loaded by typing "experiment_name.py load".
    #Below is an example of how to set up an experiment.
